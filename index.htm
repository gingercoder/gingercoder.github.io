Greetings interested citizen of Earth! You just peeked behind the curtain to the menagerie beyond.
Home and development launchpad for Rick Trotter , a ginger systems engineer from the Northeast of 
England - a place renowned for Industry, The birthplace of steam locomotives; The safety match; 
Parmo's and Digital businesses punching above their weight.
There is little here anymore because I have little time to elevate my thoughts beyond the confines 
of my head, discussion and current work patterns. Maybe one day I might return with some greater 
words of wisdom, technical expertise and suchlike, but alas today is not that day.

        <h1>gingerCoder( )</h1>
        <p>Last of the Gen-X series and born in the heart of Teesside - gingerCoder can be found behind a computer screen, behind a musical instrument or in front of an audience.</p>

            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I've worked in a plethora of areas over the years ( check out my   <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rick-trotter/29/5a1/766" target="linkwin">LinkedIn profile</a> ) 
                with a number of very successful projects to my name but I'm still learning daily!</p>
            <p>I'm a sucker for anything Victorian, especially anything scientific or engineering-focused from that era. 
                I play a variety of instruments including the cigar box guitar, I'm building a cottage garden in my spare time and growing my own vegetables.</p>
            <p>
            Currently I'm working as a Lead Cloud Operations Specialist at <a href="https://www.scottlogic.com/" target="workWindow">Scott Logic</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            I sometimes do speaking events and even write the odd book. If you'd like me to do that sort of thing for you, contact me!
